Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Document Information

Product Name: Product Promo Video Generator (PPVG App)
Version: 1.0
Date: September 28, 2025
Author: Grok 4 (xAI Assistant)
Purpose: This PRD defines the requirements for a mobile/web app that enables users to generate promotional videos for products using AI-driven script generation and avatar-based video synthesis. The app integrates with an LLM for script creation, supports RAG/fine-tuning for customization, and adheres to a minimalist design with a specified color palette.
Intended Use: This PRD is designed to be used as input for the CODEX ChatGPT-5 model to generate code, prototypes, or further development artifacts.

2. Product Overview
2.1 Problem Statement
Businesses and marketers often need quick, engaging promotional videos for products but lack the resources for professional scriptwriting, voice acting, or video production. Existing tools are fragmented, requiring multiple platforms for script generation, approval, and video creation. This app solves this by providing an end-to-end solution: input product details, AI-generated script, user approval, and automated video generation with a customizable avatar using lip-sync technology.
2.2 Product Description
The PPVG App is a user-friendly platform where users input product information, an integrated LLM generates a concise script (up to 1 minute), the user reviews and approves it, and the app produces a video featuring a pre-established avatar speaking the script via Infinite Talk lip-sync model. The app supports LLM customization through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or fine-tuning to align scripts with company-specific guidelines and tone.
2.3 Key Objectives

Enable rapid creation of product promo videos.
Ensure scripts are tailored to company branding via LLM enhancements.
Provide an intuitive, minimalist interface for seamless user experience.
Integrate with external APIs/services for LLM and video generation.

2.4 Scope

In Scope:

User authentication and profile management.
Product input form.
LLM-based script generation with RAG/fine-tuning options.
Script approval workflow.
Video generation using Infinite Talk avatar lip-sync.

Basic analytics on generated content.


Out of Scope:

Advanced video editing (e.g., custom backgrounds, effects).
Multi-language support beyond English (initial release).
Payment integration for premium features.
Custom avatar creation (use pre-established avatars only).

Security: Encrypt user data; API keys for integrations stored securely.
Scalability: Handle up to 1,000 active users; cloud-based backend.
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliant; support screen readers.
Platforms: Mobile (iOS/Android) and Web (responsive design).

5. User Flows
5.1 Main User Flow: Generate Promo Video

User logs in.
Navigates to "Create New Video" screen.
Inputs product details via form.
Submits; app generates script using LLM (with RAG if customized).
Reviews script: Edit, approve, or regenerate.
On approval, selects avatar and generates video.
Previews video; downloads or shares.

5.2 Customization Flow

From profile/settings: Upload brand guidelines document.
Choose RAG mode: App indexes document for future generations.
Or fine-tune: Upload dataset; trigger backend process (async notification on completion).

6. Technical Requirements
6.1 Integrations

LLM API: Compatible with models like GPT series; support RAG via vector databases (e.g., Pinecone).
Fine-Tuning: Use services like Hugging Face or OpenAI fine-tuning APIs.
Video Synthesis: Infinite Talk API for lip-sync; TTS integration (e.g., ElevenLabs).
Backend: Node.js/Python with cloud hosting (e.g., AWS/GCP).
Frontend: React Native for cross-platform mobile/web.

Error logging for integrations.

7. Design Guidelines
7.1 Overall Design Principles

Style: Minimalist, intuitive, user-friendly.
Color Palette:

Primary: Blue (#007BFF) for buttons, headers.
Secondary: White (#FFFFFF) for backgrounds, text.
Accents: Yellow (#FFD700) for highlights, calls-to-action (e.g., approve button).


Typography: Sans-serif fonts (e.g., Roboto or Inter); clean and readable.

UI Elements:

Buttons: Rounded, with subtle shadows.
Forms: Single-column, with real-time validation.
Loading States: Spinner with blue/yellow accents.


User Experience: One-tap actions where possible; guided tutorials for first-time users.

7.2 Wireframe Sketches (High-Level Description)

Home Screen: Dashboard with recent videos; "Create New" button (blue with yellow icon).
Create Screen: Stepper UI (Input > Script > Approve > Generate > Preview).
Settings Screen: Sections for LLM customization, with upload buttons.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies
8.1 Assumptions

Users have internet access for API calls.
Infinite Talk API is available and supports the required features.

Initial avatars are pre-loaded; no user-uploaded avatars.

8.2 Dependencies

Third-party APIs: LLM (e.g., OpenAI), Infinite Talk, TTS.
Development Tools: For CODEX ChatGPT-5 integration, assume API access for code generation based on this PRD.

8.3 Risks and Mitigations

Risk: API downtime – Mitigation: Fallback to cached models.
Risk: High generation costs – Mitigation: Usage quotas per user.
Risk: Script quality variance – Mitigation: User feedback loop for regeneration.

9. Success Metrics

User Adoption: 500 active users in first 3 months.
Engagement: 80% completion rate for video generation flows.
Satisfaction: NPS >7 via in-app surveys.
Technical: <5% error rate in integrations.
